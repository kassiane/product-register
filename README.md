# product-register
This project is consisted by two parts:
- product-register-gui: This is where the gui is. It was asked to be in Java Swing, so there it is.
- product-register-service: This is where the service is, separating the domain, db from the interface.

To be continued: 
* create a web interface.
* add two repositories: one for the application and other for tests.
